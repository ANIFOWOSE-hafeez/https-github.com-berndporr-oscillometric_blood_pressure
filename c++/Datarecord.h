//! The Datarecord Class
/*!
 * The class Datarecord is used to store data in a file. There are two options. One is to store it sample by sample,
 * the other by handing it a vector of doubles to store. If the sampling rate is supplied, it will save the values
 * with the corresponding time. Otherwise, data will be numbered with the sample. In this application, the data is
 * stored at the end of a measurement. A vector is handed to the object together with a file name that represents the
 * current date and time.
