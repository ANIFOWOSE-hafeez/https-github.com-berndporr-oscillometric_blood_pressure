psth-vep
-----------

This program performs averaging over repetitive stimuli. It can
work on discrete events such as spikes or on continous data
such as visually evoked potentials.

It was initially developed to read and display data from Tobi
Delbrücks neuromorphic analog VLSI retina/simple cell chip
(http://http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~tobi/friend/). This compilation proved to be a
nice setup for classroom demonstrations.

For data acquisition, the comedi library (http://www.comedi.org/) is used, so
any comedi device may be used to fetch the data. It has been tested with the
USB-DUX (http://www.linux-usb-daq.co.uk/).

Installation
------------

You need the following libraries to compile and run the program:

Comedi: http://www.comedi.org
Qt4: http://qt.nokia.com
Qwt6: http://qwt.sourceforge.net

These are all part of, for example, UBUNTU Linux.

Once all libraries are up and running, have a look at "physio_psth.pro" and
modify it.

Then run "qmake", which should generate a Makefile and "make" to compile
everything.
