obp (oscillometric blood pressure)
-----------

This program currently only reads data and displays it. 

It is based on a project that was initially developed to read and display data from Tobi
Delbr√ºcks neuromorphic analog VLSI retina/simple cell chip
(http://http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~tobi/friend/). This compilation proved to be a
nice setup for classroom demonstrations.

For data acquisition, the comedi library (http://www.comedi.org/) is used, so
any comedi device may be used to fetch the data. It has been tested with the
USB-DUX (http://www.linux-usb-daq.co.uk/).

Installation (C++)
------------

You need the following libraries to compile and run the program:

Comedi (http://www.comedi.org), Qt5 and Qwt

These are all part of, for example, UBUNTU Linux.

Run "qmake", which should generate a Makefile and "make" to compile
everything.

Alternatively, the project is now also set-up as a cmake project. 
Run "cmake ." to generate the Makefile and make to compile.
