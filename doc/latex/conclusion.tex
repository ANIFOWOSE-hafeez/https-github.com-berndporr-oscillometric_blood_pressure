\chapter{Conclusion} %TODO probably redundant to results?

This chapter discusses the outcome of the project and proposes the next steps to take.

Try not to mention "IT"

%Testing on human subjects other than the developer could not take place due to the situation at the time of writing. A concept for testing was introduced and approved by the risk assessment department, however, the ethics application could not be resolved with the situation making the application process impossible to go through in the short period of time that this thesis was written.


The goal of this project was to be able to conduct experiments with test subjects and to record datasets. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing situation when this project was conducted, this was not possible. Even though all possible safety measurements were considered and approved by the University's risk assessment department, the approval process was rendered impossible to go through within the given time frame. Apart from not being able to record any datasets, the algorithm might suffer from systematic errors due to subjective charasteristics in the developers blood pressure oscillations.
