Declaration

With the exception of chapters 1, 2 and 3, which contain introductory material, all work in this thesis was carried out by the author unless otherwise explicitly stated.



Introduction


This is the university logo, used as an example because it is needed for the front page.

Here starts the thesis with some text to check that things are working. Let's refer to figure  to check that the captions and labels work. I shall also check that sanserif and typewriter work. And here is equation () too,

A report is a formal document and should be written in appropriate language. Numerous books offer advice on writing reports and a selection is listed in the references at the end. Here are a few tips.

Reports should be written in correct English. Break text into paragraphs, keep sentences to a reasonable length and insert appropriate punctuation. Use a spell-checker and a grammar-checker if desired but neither is a substitute for careful reading.
A report is not a story.
Write 'The voltage was measured' rather than 'I measured the voltage'. This document contains instructions and therefore uses a different style.
Define all abbreviations when they are first used: 'The accelerometer uses a serial peripheral interface (SPI)'. Provide a list of abbreviations if you use a large number of them.
Don't write material that you don't understand. It will be obvious to the reader.
The quality of English is assessed as part of the report. Foreign students may feel this to be a burden but part of their education in this country is to learn to work effectively in an English-speaking environment.

Precision

An engineering report must be precise. This applies both to the language and to numerical values. For example, the words precision and accuracy are often used interchangably in non-technical discussion but the distinction between them is vital in engineering. Vague, waffly text is a major weakness of many students' technical reports (and examination answers).

A subsection

Figures (diagrams, photographs etc) and tables must have informative captions and be numbered. Axes of graphs should have scales, titles and units, otherwise the plot is meaningless. Multiple curves must be labelled, either directly or with a caption. Use dotted or dashed lines as well as colour for clarity; remember that the reader might be colour-blind or have only a black-and-white printout. All text must be legible, roughly the same size as the main text. Be warned that plots from Excel or Matlab need extensive editing to bring them up to an acceptable standard. Experimental traces can be captured on most modern test equipment and can make good illustrations.

[theory]Theory 
This chapter discusses the findings of researching existing and proposed algorithms for determining systolic and diastolic blood pressure through the oscillometric method.

The method was described and tested by Geddes et al. in 1982. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) is generally described as the pressure at which oscillation amplitudes are maximal. Geddes is determining ratios of the MAP to find the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. He defines the ratio for the systolic pressure to be 0.5 and the ratio for the diastolic pulse as 0.8. These ratios were found in an experimental way and Geddes acknowledges that the systolic pressure is overestimated and the ratio for the diastolic pulse is not constant for a range of different diastolic pressures.

Later studies tried to find accurate ratios, mostly experimentally. Mathematical models confirmed that a generalised ratio cannot be found. Parameters like the age of the subject and in this regard, the arterial stiffness influence the ratios.
[sw]Software

This chapter contains a description of the developed software. It provides a brief overview of the important architecture and algorithm implementations. The projects GitHub page provides full documentation. The project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0. 

[results]Results and Discussion

This chapter highlights important results of the project.


- valve needs to open continuously to have a steady stream of 3mmHg/s
  opening introduces noise

- many algorithms only work for clean data

- MAP is used for diagnostics 

[conclusion]Conclusion

This chapter discusses the outcome of the project and proposes the next steps to take.

Try not to mention "IT"

Testing on human subjects other than the developer could not take place due to the situation at the time of writing. A concept for testing was introduced and approved by the risk assessment department, however, the ethics application could not be resolved with the situation making the application process impossible to go through in the short period of time that this thesis was written.


Derivation of the equation

This is such boring material that it has been relegated to an appendix. Let's check an equation:

Let's hope I got it correct.
