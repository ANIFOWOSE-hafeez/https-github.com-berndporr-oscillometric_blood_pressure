This chapter discusses the findings of researching existing and proposed algorithms for determining systolic and diastolic blood pressure through the oscillometric method.

The method was described and tested by Geddes et al. in 1982 \cite{Geddes1982}. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) is generally described as the pressure at which oscillation amplitudes are maximal. Geddes is determining ratios of the MAP to find the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. He defines the ratio for the systolic pressure to be 0.5 and the ratio for the diastolic pulse as 0.8. These ratios were found in an experimental way and Geddes acknowledges that the systolic pressure is overestimated and the ratio for the diastolic pulse is not constant for a range of different diastolic pressures.

Later studies tried to find accurate ratios, mostly experimentally. Mathematical models confirmed that a generalised ratio cannot be found. Parameters like the age of the subject and in this regard, the arterial stiffness influence the ratios. \cite{Babbs2012}
