\chapter{Results and Discussion}\label{cp:res}


This chapter highlights important results of the project.


- valve needs to open continuously to have a steady stream of 3mmHg/s
  opening introduces noise

- many algorithms only work for clean data

- MAP is used for diagnostics

- why are microphones not used to determine blood pressure with the karakoff sounds?

- PTT (beyond oscillometry)

%mention artifact remvoal:
%what artifacts: high frequency noise, movement, muscle contractions
% --> how to make sure only artifacts and not information is remvoed?
Â¨
\section{General Problems with Algorithms}
most algorithms expect perfect data to be 'perfect'

natural variablility of blood pressure during measurement
left and right arm difference 10mmHg normal


mmHg is no longer a SI unit since 2019
