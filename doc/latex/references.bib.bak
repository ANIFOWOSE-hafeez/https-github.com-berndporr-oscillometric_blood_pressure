only 25 subjects tested, not really a new algorithm, because in the end, it still uses the fixed-ratio method, but adds artifact removal and compares it to some model based algorithms. 
results were evaluated by comparing them to the accusatory method (BHS standard, but old)

interesting part: 
We further demonstrated from our analysis results (Tables 5 and 6) that the usage of variable characteristic ratio derived based on several features extracted from the OWE improved the blood pressure estimation accuracy over the conventional MAA method using fixed characteristic ratios

  abstract = {A mathematical lumped parameter model of the oscillometric technique for indirect blood pressure measurement is presented. The model includes cuff compliance, pressure transmission from the cuff to the brachial artery through the soft tissue of the arm, and the biomechanics of the brachial artery both at positive and negative transmural pressure values. The main aspects of oscillometry are simulated i.e., the increase in cuff pressure pulsatility during cuff deflation maneuvers, the existence of a point of maximum pulsations (about 1.5 mmHg) at a cuff pressure close to mean arterial pressure, and the characteristic ratios for cuff pressure pulsatility at systole and diastole (0.52 and 0.70, respectively, with this model, using basal parameters and an individual set of data for the arterial pressure waveform). Subsequently, the model is used to examine how alterations in some biomechanical factors may prejudice the accuracy of pressure measurement. Numerical simulations indicate that alterations in wall viscoelastic properties and in arterial pressure pulse amplitude may significantly affect the accuracy of pressure estimates, leading to errors as great as 15-20% in the computation of diastolic and systolic arterial pressure. By contrast, changes in arterial pressure mean value and cuff compliance do not seem to have significant influence on the measurement. Evaluation of mean arterial pressure through a characteristic ratio is not robust and may lead to misleading results. Mean arterial pressure may be better evaluated as the lowest pressure at which cuff pulse amplitude reaches a plateau.

  comment  = {attempt to mathematically prove oscillometric method. compares obtained values to Geddes. 
conclusion: Geddes values can possibly be made more accurate, because systolic pressure was obtained by him through the accusatory method and that ofent overestimates it. for high arterial pressures, the ratios should be lowered and vice versa. 
MAP should be estimated as the lowest cuff pressure where oscillations have a plateau.
in the end: accusatory method should be used for sys/dia measurement and oscillometric method for esitmation of MAP},

The selected feature vector is then represented by the Gaussian mixture model. The SBPR and DBPR are subsequently obtained with the help of the GMR and then mapped back to SBP and DBP values that are more accurate than those obtained with the conventional MAA method.},

  abstract = {A new instrument for the indirect noninvasive measurement of mean arterial pressure (m.a.p.) has been constructed and evaluated in man. The instrument does not require an external microphone or transducer and determines m.a.p. rather than systolic and diastolic pressure. Instead, the method employs the point of maximal oscillations as an indicator of m.a.p. The instrument automatically inflates a standard blood pressure cuff and determines the m.a.p. by measuring the cuff pressure oscillations as the cuff pressure is reduced by discrete increments. Cuff deflation in discrete increments, instead of continuously, allows the oscillation data obtained at each cuff pressure to be tested for artefacts and averaged, greatly enhancing artefact-rejection ability. The m.a.p. is selected as the lowest cuff pressure at which the oscillation amplitude is a maximum. The instrument was tested on the bicep and ankle in a series of 28 studies involving 17 human subjects with intra-arterial catheters. Averaging the mean errors from each of the 28 studies, there was an overall mean error of -- 0·23 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 4·21 mmHg. The correlation coefficient was 0·98. The instrument was found to give good results in a wide variety of clinical subjects and physiologic states.},
